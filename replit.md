# ecoKART - Sustainable E-commerce Platform

## Overview

ecoKART is a sustainable e-commerce platform built as a full-stack web application that connects eco-conscious consumers with verified sustainable products. The platform focuses on environmental impact tracking, rewarding users for eco-friendly purchases, and providing a marketplace for certified sustainable sellers.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite for build tooling
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom eco-friendly color scheme
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing

### Architecture Pattern
The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code:
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend API
- `shared/` - Common schemas and types shared between frontend and backend

## Key Components

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL + Drizzle)
- **Users**: User profiles with eco-impact tracking (total points, CO2 saved)
- **Sellers**: Business verification system with certification tracking
- **Categories**: Product categorization system
- **Products**: Product catalog with sustainability metrics
- **Shopping Cart**: User cart management
- **Orders**: Order processing and tracking
- **CO2 Contributions**: Environmental impact tracking per transaction
- **Sessions**: Secure session management for authentication

### Authentication System
- Replit Auth integration with OpenID Connect
- Session-based authentication using PostgreSQL session store
- Secure cookie management with HTTP-only flags
- User profile management with automatic user creation

### API Structure
RESTful API with the following main endpoints:
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication routes
- `/api/products` - Product catalog management
- `/api/cart` - Shopping cart operations
- `/api/orders` - Order management
- `/api/stats` - User and global statistics
- `/api/sellers` - Seller management and verification

### Frontend Architecture
- Component-based React architecture
- Custom hook system for authentication (`useAuth`)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Real-time cart updates using TanStack Query
- Form validation using React Hook Form with Zod schemas

## Data Flow

2. **Authentication**: Users authenticate via Replit Auth
3. **Product Discovery**: Browse products with sustainability filters
4. **Shopping Cart**: Add products with real-time cart updates
5. **Checkout**: Secure payment processing with CO2 impact calculation
6. **Order Tracking**: View order history and environmental impact

### Seller Journey
